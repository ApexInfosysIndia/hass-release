# Home Assistant Release helpers

Some helper scripts to help create release notes.

 - Repo needs to be cloned as a sister repo to home-assistant.
 - Create a token on GitHub and write it to `.token` in repo dir
 - Right now version is hardcoded in `hassrelease/__main__.py`
 - Run with `python3 -m hassrelease`
